  Dear Dr. Srinivasan,

  Please, I downloaded your TOP MOD and I d like to know how can I move the
  shapes as I saw in the training video showned in
  http://www-viz.tamu.edu/faculty/ergun/research/topology/TopMod/Introduction/menu.html 
  The presenter ~Stouch~T and rotate, zoom etc the cube (in file
  cube.obj) and I don~Rt know how can I do the same.

  Is there another professional/commercial version with more commands or
  funtionalities blocked in this demo version distributed? How can I learn to
  use you software. I am reading all articles writed by you and I need to know
  where can I download the correct program.

  Thanks

  Dear Sir,
  I am sorry to bother you, but I was wondering where or if I could get the
  source or a binary of TopMod for Linux. I can only seem to find it for
  Windows. I read that it was originally written for Linux in C++. Is there
  somewhere I can download it? I have searched but have come up empty.
  Thank You for your time.
